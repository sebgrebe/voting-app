# voting-app
<p> App for creating and voting in polls. </p>
<p>Built with ReactJS, mongodb and express.js, created for freecodecamp's backend cert.</p>
<p>I've written some notes on how I built this project here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-g3sFez3_gQrfYxdIxs8IHdKWCRIyDixQrxln27mTbg</p>
<b>Run locally</b>
<p>To run locally, create an .env file in the main directory and paste in the MONGODB_LOCAL variable from .env.example. Then create and run a mongodb database called 'voting'.</p>
